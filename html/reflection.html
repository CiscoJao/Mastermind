            <div class='intro'>
                <p>During my time in the ICSU4 course, I learned many ways I can apply problem solving to real world examples. To the outside world, the subject of computer science may seem like a tech-only oriented field of study. But that cannot be any more incorrect. Beyond the computer and the tech skills, computer science requires a long list of "soft skills". These are skills that are usually based on personality and character.</p>

            <div class='career'>
                <p>The career I wish to pursue in the future is aerospace engineering, or an engineering in that field. I have always dreamed of what flying would feel like, and what batter way to experience that than going to space? But what's even more interesting to me is the technology we achieve in order to fly or go to space. I always saw aerospace as being one of the most advanced and radical forms of engineering. I know the field of aerospace requires many fields and areas of studies, there are just so many problems to tackle that you need an expert in many different specific fields. My goals are to study mechanical or mechatronics engineering. But even if I am pursuing mechanical and mechatronics, knowing computer science is still vital. If I stay true to my goals, I will be working close to a lot of machines, and machines still need instructions on how to function. Having computer science as one of my skills in my back pocket will become extremely useful because I can use it to test machines. If I end up working with a software engineer, I can understand their job and what they are doing a lot better and even end up helping them on the project. Knowing computer science will also tell my superiors what type of person I am. They will see that I dedicated some of my time on learning this skill in order to enrich my "tool set". On top of all these technical advantages, I also know that the soft skills I learned in computer science will come in handy. Engineering is a field that requires more than just technical knowledge. Time management is important to be efficient and planning out projects and meetings with other people. Collaboration and communication is essential for engineers to share their ideas and thoughts. Analytical and problem solving skills will be useful when designing and innovating projects. Most importantly thought, I learned perseverance in computer science. There is no such thing as a "perfect" design on the first try. My code always had bugs or errors that I had to fix. This thought me perseverance in the sense that I have to keep working if I want my projects to turn out how I want them to. This is an important lesson to learn for the field of aerospace engineering, it is a very daunting field where some people's lives will depend on my designs. I need to persevere and perfect my designs because in aerospace engineering they HAVE to be perfect.</p>

            <div class='scenario-1'>
                <h4>Scenario 1</h4>
                <p>The first scenario where computer science might be useful in my career goals is during a team meeting where we have to discuss how a machine will run or function. After the design process is finished and we have decided on what type of machine it will be, we now need to know how it will receive instructions. In the world we live in today, technology is rapidly advancing and most things are now running on coding languages. If I have to work with other engineers on designing a machine, then knowing computer science will be useful. Even if it isn't going to be my main field of expertise, I can still collaborate with team members where computer science is their expertise. I will be able to understand them and even help them out on the design process of the software. Because of my knowledge in computer science, I won't be completely in the dark when it comes to designing the machine.</p>

            <div class='scenario-2'>
                <h4>Scenario 2</h4>
                <p>Also, knowing how a machine works "under the hood" will be useful during the tweaking and trouble shooting process. If a glitch comes up during the troubleshooting process, I can quickly determine if it is a hardware issue or a software issue without needing help from an expert. If it is a very small glitch in the software, I can even solve it myself if expert help isn't available at the moment. Also, it will help in determining if the hardware isn't compatible with the software. If I had no knowledge of computer science and how computers take instructions and something goes wrong in the machine, I could make things worse. For example, if the machine just stops working, it could be because the software crashed from an error. If I didn't understand that this could happen, I could end up thinking it is a problem in the hardware and change something I didn't need to change.</p>

            <div class='scenario-3'>
                <h4>Scenario 3</h4>
                <p>I can do solo projects in my spare time or learn more technical skills easier. I am confident in saying that I have an intermediate level of knowledge in javascript now, and this has allowed me to learn other languages faster and easier. Because I know one programming language, I understand the basic concepts that all languages have. I know that every language has some way of storing data (variables), manipulating said data, and a way to interact with the computer and the user (input and output). It's like finding a language with the same grammar and sentence structure as English, so all I really need to learn are the words and vocabulary. If I needed to learn a new language for an upcoming engineering language, I can learn it a lot faster because of my understanding of fundamental concepts in computer science. Over the summer, I actually started learning C and a little bit of python. Because of my experience in javascript, I was able to skip the basics of learning variables, arithmetic operations, conditions, etc. Computer science builds habits that are useful in almost all fields of technology.</p>
