                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>There are two types of lights, the large main lights and the smaller lights. There are 6 different colours for the main lights and only 2 colours for the smaller lights.</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The ship's computer is smart! Because of this it will only give you 10 chances to guess the code. Your job private, is to hack into the ship's mainframe before the ship's AI locks you out. We're counting on you.</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <p>A new code generated every time the ship's AI starts up. Our enemy has done this on purpose to keep their ship secure, but don't fret private! This is what we trained you for!</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <p>You can input any sequence of colours you wish. When this happens, the ship's AI will give you information about your guessed code. If you guessed one of the colours, a red light will appear. If you guessed one of the colours, AND it is in the correct position, a black light will appear.</p> 
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    <li> 
                        <p>We have connected your SuperSpyCodeDestroyer 5000 to the ship's mainframe so you can save some time. Press numbers 1-6 to select the colour you want to input. We placed the bindings on your SuperSpyCodeDestroyer 5000 so you know which number corresponds with which colour.</p> 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Press [enter] to input and check the code you are currently guessing. After pressing this button the ship's AI will turn on the small lights on the side depending on the correctness of your guess.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Press [backspace] before pressing enter to delete all your guesses in the current row.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Press [space] to reload the game. You can restart the game even after winning or losing.</p>
